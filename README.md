In this assigment i chose to predict the stockmarket price for Norwegian airline. I also chose to use a linear regression algorithm, but it did not work very well. I chose this to try and priduct the stock price on a specific day. Polynomial regression might have been better. 
If i wanted to fint whether or not the stock price went up or down i couldve used a classification algorithm.
